The first step into a new world

I hope to use GitHub to learn how software is developed in the professional world as opposed to the way small classroom assignments are handled.

My first GitHub project will be a Custom Roster Generator for use in single-player multi-character games.
In the ShackTactical community, there is a tradition of naming characters in such games after other community members. With some games (like XCOM) this is accomplished with modified game files to alter the random pool that the game generates names from. However in some games (like Rimworld) such modification is not as simple. This will be a standalone program that will allow the user to generate a randomized roster from a larger name list.
